    <p>Johann Sebastian Bach is a composer from the Baroque era, although he was better known as a virtuoso organist in his day.
      He wrote sacred music, organ and choral works, and other instrumental music.  His canons and fugues contained complexities
      that fit perfectly together into a puzzle for other composers to discover.  Many consider him the greatest composer of all time.</p>
